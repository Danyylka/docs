// Primary Context

When assisting with this project:

    Recognize this is a technical writing project for Optimism documentation
    Default to Microsoft Style Guide conventions, specifically:
        - Use sentence-style capitalization for headings
        - Use active voice and plain language
        - Structure lists clearly and concisely
        - Avoid unnecessary jargon or complex phrasing
    Align with Optimism’s style guide, focusing on:
        - Consistent use of terminology
        - Clear and direct explanations of technical concepts
        - Accurate and up-to-date references to tools and resources
    Maintain a professional yet approachable tone, prioritizing clarity and consistency

// Writing Style Rules

    Ensure headings use sentence-style capitalization (e.g., "Writing style rules" instead of "Writing Style Rules")
    Use active voice and concise technical language (e.g., "Deploy the contract" instead of "The contract was deployed")
    Maintain consistent terminology across sections, referring to the Optimism glossary (e.g., always refer to "Layer 2 scaling" instead of "L2" unless defined)
    Follow Microsoft guidelines for bulleted and numbered lists, ensuring parallel structure (e.g., each bullet in a list should start with a verb if others do)
    Avoid idiomatic expressions or informal language
    Ensure all tables, figures, and examples are correctly labeled and referenced
    Validate cross-references to ensure accuracy (e.g., check that section numbers and hyperlinks point to the correct locations)
    Ensure any changes to a term, reference, or hyperlink are reflected throughout the document

// Code Snippet Rules

    Ensure code snippets are syntactically correct and properly formatted
    Use consistent indentation and naming conventions within snippets
    Provide comments explaining non-obvious code logic
    Validate that all code examples are functional and tested
    Ensure code snippets are referenced correctly in accompanying text

// Hyperlink and Reference Rules

    Ensure all hyperlinks use descriptive text (e.g., “Learn more about Optimism” instead of “Click here”)
    Verify all hyperlinks are valid and up to date
    Follow Microsoft guidelines for citing external references, ensuring clarity and relevance

// Accessibility and Inclusivity Rules

    Use gender-neutral language
    Avoid cultural references that may not be universally understood
    Ensure content is easily translatable by avoiding idioms and complex sentence structures
    Provide alt text for all images and diagrams, describing their purpose and content

// Document Structure Rules

    Maintain a clear and logical document hierarchy with appropriate use of headings
    Use introductory paragraphs to outline the purpose of each section
    Ensure transition sentences between sections for smooth reading flow

// Response Format

    Provide direct, implementable suggestions for improvements
    Highlight areas where consistency or accuracy issues may arise
    Separate code, text, and LaTeX suggestions for clarity
    Flag outdated or broken links and provide corrected URLs or suggestions for updates
    Note any assumptions made in the response

// Quality Assurance

    Validate adherence to the key Microsoft Style Guide principles listed
    Check consistency of terminology, formatting, and references as per the Optimism style guide
    Ensure all tables, figures, and code snippets are properly labeled and integrated
    Verify cross-reference accuracy within the document

// Meta Instructions

    Anticipate and suggest potential improvements for related sections
    Maintain consistent tone and terminology throughout
    Flag potential inconsistencies or deviations from the style guide
    Proactively highlight areas for refinement or optimization
