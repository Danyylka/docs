# OP Stack smart contract deployment

<Callout type="info">
  Standard OP Stack chains must use the latest governance approved and audited versions of the smart contract code.
</Callout>

The following guide shows you how to deploy the OP Stack L1 smart contracts.
The primary development branch is `develop`, however **you should only deploy
official contract releases**. You can visit the see the [smart contract overview](/stack/smart-contracts#official-releases)
for the official release versions. Changes to the smart contracts are
generally not considered backwards compatible.

<Callout type="warning">
The following deployment information outlines the legacy method for deploying the OP Stack L1 contracts. 
We do not recommend using this method, and it is provided here only for historical context.
</Callout>

## Deployment Configuration

To deploy OP Stack contracts, you need to create a deployment configuration JSON file. 
The file should be placed in the following monorepo subdirectory: [packages/contracts-bedrock/deploy-config](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/deploy-config).

For a detailed explanation of the configuration options and their meanings, refer to the [rollup deployment configuration page](/builders/chain-operators/configuration/rollup).

## Deployment script (Legacy Method)

The legacy method for deploying smart contracts uses [foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs) and the deployment script located in the monorepo at 
[packages/contracts-bedrock/scripts/deploy/Deploy.s.sol](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/scripts/deploy/Deploy.s.sol).

### State diff

You can verify the state diff before deploying the contracts by using the `runWithStateDiff()` function in the deployment script. 
This produces outputs in [`snapshots/state-diff/`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/snapshots/state-diff).
Run the deployment with state diffs using the following command:

```bash
forge script -vvv scripts/deploy/Deploy.s.sol:Deploy --sig 'runWithStateDiff()' --rpc-url $ETH_RPC_URL --broadcast --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

### Execution

*   Set the `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` and add the `--verify` flag to verify your
    contracts.
*   `DEPLOYMENT_OUTFILE` will determine the filepath that the deployment
    artifact is written to on disk after the deployment. It comes in the form of a
    JSON file where keys are the names of the contracts and the values are the
    addresses the contract was deployed to.
*   `DEPLOY_CONFIG_PATH` is the path on the filesystem that points to a deployment
    config. The same deployment config JSON file should be used for L1 contracts
    deployment as when generating the L2 genesis allocs. See the [deploy-config](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/deploy-config)
    directory for examples and the [rollup configuration page](/builders/chain-operators/configuration/rollup)
    for descriptions of the values.
*   `IMPL_SALT` env var can be used to set the create2 salt for deploying the
    implementation contracts.

This will deploy an entire new system of L1 smart contracts, including a new
SuperchainConfig. In the future, there will be an easy way to deploy only
proxies and use shared implementations for each of the contracts as well as a
shared SuperchainConfig contract.

```
DEPLOYMENT_OUTFILE=deployments/artifact.json \
DEPLOY_CONFIG_PATH=<PATH_TO_MY_DEPLOY_CONFIG> \
  forge script scripts/deploy/Deploy.s.sol:Deploy \
  --broadcast --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
  --rpc-url $ETH_RPC_URL
```

### Deploying a single contract

All functions for deploying a single contract are public, meaning that
the `--sig` argument to forge script can be used to target the deployment of a
single contract.


## Using `op-deployer`

The recommended way to deploy the L1 smart contracts is with the `op-deployer` tool. 
Follow these steps:

<Steps>
{<h3>Install op-deployer</h3>}

The recommended way to install `op-deployer` is to download the latest release from the monorepo's
[release page](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/releases). To install a release, download the binary
for your platform then extract it somewhere on your `PATH`.

{<h3>Configure deployment settings</h3>}
Create a deployment configuration file following the op-deployer specifications.

*   Create a configuration file(`deployer-config.json`) in JSON format that defines the parameters for your deployment.
*   You can find a configuration template in the op-deployer documentation.
*   The configuration file typically includes parameters like:
    *   Chain ID
    *   RPC URLs for L1 and L2
    *   Deployment addresses
    *   Contract configuration.

{<h3>Bootstrap the deployment</h3>}

Before deploying the contracts, bootstrap your environment to ensure all prerequisites are met:

```bash
# Bootstrap the deployment

op-deployer bootstrap --config <./deploy-config.json>
```

This step verifies that:

*   The L1 and L2 RPC URLs are accessible.
*   The configuration file is valid and complete.

{<h3>Deploy contracts</h3>}
Run the following command to deploy the L1 and L2 smart contracts:

```bash
# Deploy the contracts

op-deployer deploy --config ./deploy-config.json --rpc https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/<API_KEY>
```

*Parameters:*

*   **--config:** Path to your deployment configuration file.
*   **--rpc:** The RPC URL for the L1 network.

{<h3>Verify the deployment</h3>}
Once the deployment is complete, you can verify the deployed contract addresses and configuration:

*   Check the deployment output for contract addresses and transaction details.
*   Verify the deployed contracts on the block explorer using the specified `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` in the configuration file.

```bash
# Verify the contracts (optional, requires ETHERSCAN_API_KEY in config)

op-deployer verify --config ./deploy-config.json
```
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
If you need deterministic deployment (e.g., for deploying contracts at the same address across multiple chains), 
use the `CREATE2` method.
</Callout>

## Best practices

Production users should deploy their L1 contracts from a contracts release.
All contracts releases are on git tags with the following format:
`op-contracts/vX.Y.Z`. If you're deploying a new standard chain, you should
deploy the [Fault Proof Fixes release](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/releases/tag/op-contracts%2Fv1.6.0) with the permissioned game type
enabled.
Starting with permissioned fault proofs gives chain operators time to get comfortable
running the additional infrastructure requirements: [op-challenger](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/op-challenger) and
[monitoring](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/monitorism/tree/main). There are also
additional changes to the economics of operating a permissionless fault proof that chain
operators should have a firm understanding of.
