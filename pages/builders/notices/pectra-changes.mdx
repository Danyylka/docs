# Preparing for Pectra breaking changes

This page outlines breaking changes related to the Ethereum Pectra (Prague-Electra) hard fork for chain operators and node operators on OP Stack chains.
If you experience difficulty at any stage of this process, please reach out to [developer support](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/developers/discussions).

<Callout type="info">
  *    This page will be updated continuously with information on upgrade runbooks and timelines as they come.
  *    The Pectra upgrade for Holocene L1 proposed activation is on **Wed Feb 12**.
  *    The Pectra upgrade for Sepolia L1 proposed activation is on **Wed Feb 19**.
  *    The Pectra upgrade for Ethereum L1 will be activated in **March**.

## What's included in Pectra?

Pectra contains a variety of EIPs, some of which apply to the OP Stack; others do not. The following EIPs are included in Pectra as outlined in the [Pectra Devnet 5 notes](https://notes.ethereum.org/@ethpandaops/pectra-devnet-5):

## For chain operators

The OP Stack is approaching the Pectra upgrade in two parts:

1. Make the necessary upgrades to make sure OP Stack chains do not break when the L1 pectra upgrade activates
2. Upgrade OP Stack chains to support Pectra's new features that apply to L2s

### For fault proof enabled chains



## For node operators

Node operators will need to upgrade to the respective releases before the activation dates.

These following steps are necessary for every node operator:

<Steps>
  ### Update to the latest release

  *   [`op-node` at ``]()
  *   [`op-geth` at ``]()

  ### Verify Your Configuration

  
</Steps>
