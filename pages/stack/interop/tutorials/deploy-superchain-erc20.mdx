The SuperchainERC20 standard is ready for production use with active Mainnet deployments. 
However, the OP Stack interoperability upgrade, required for crosschain messaging, is currently still in active development.

# Issuing new assets with SuperchainERC20

This guide explains how to issue new assets with the [`SuperchainERC20`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/SuperchainERC20.sol) contract.
Those assets can then be bridged quickly and safely using the [`SuperchainTokenBridge` ](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/SuperchainTokenBridge.sol) contract (once interop is operational, anyway).
For more information on how it works, [see the explainer](/stack/interop/superchain-erc20).

Note that bridging assets through the Superchain using `SuperchainTokenBridge` *never* affects the total supply of your asset.
The supply remains fixed, bridging only changes the chain on which the asset is located.
The token's total amount across all network always remains the same, ensuring value stability.

To ensure fungibility across chains, `SuperchainERC20` assets *must* have the same contract address on all chains.
This requirement abstracts away the complexity of cross-chain validation.
Achieving this requires deterministic deployment methods. There are [many ways to do this](https://github.com/Arachnid/deterministic-deployment-proxy).
Here we will use the [SuperchainERC20 Starter Kit](/app-developers/starter-kit).

## Step by step explanation

<Steps>
  ### Install the prerequisites and the SuperchainERC20 Starter Kit

  1. 


  ### Deploy the `SuperchainERC20` Token Contract





  ### Implement the IERC7802 interface

  Implementations of `SuperchainERC20` will be required to implement the [IERC7802](https://specs.optimism.io/interop/token-bridging.html#ierc7802) interface, that includes two external functions and two events.

  The interface defines two functions for bridging:

  *   `sendERC20`: Initializes a cross-chain transfer of a `SuperchainERC20` by burning the tokens locally and sending a message to the `SuperchainERC20Bridge` on the target chain using the `L2toL2CrossDomainMessenger`. This ensures that asset supply remains constant, as sending an asset moves it from one chain to another without creating additional supply.
  *   `relayERC20`: Processes incoming messages from the L2toL2CrossDomainMessenger and mints the corresponding amount of the SuperchainERC20.

  [Here's an example implementation of the `SuperchainERC20Bridge`](https://specs.optimism.io/interop/token-bridging.html#implementation)
</Steps>

## Next steps
*   Use the [SuperchainERC20 Starter Kit](/app-developers/starter-kit) to deploy your token across the Superchain.
*   Explore the [SuperchainERC20 specifications](https://specs.optimism.io/interop/token-bridging.html) for in-depth implementation details.
*   Review the [Superchain Interop Explainer](../explainer) for answers to common questions about interoperability.
