# Superchain interop compatible tokens

Superchain interop enables **secure, gas-only, 1-block latency cross-chain composability** on the [Superchain interop cluster](/stack/interop/explainer#superchain-interop-cluster).
The **recommended** approach for enabling interop capabilities for tokens is using [SuperchainERC20](/stack/interop/superchain-erc20), but there are other options depending on your needs.

## How tokens go cross-chain

Compared to traditional ERC-20 tokens deployments on a single blockchain, cross-chain tokens can move between different networks through giving crosschainMint and crosschainBurn permissions to a verification mechanism (such as a bridge protocol) that validates when tokens should be burned on one chain and minted on another.

For example when transferring a SuperchainERC20 between chains in the Superchain interop cluster, the Superchain interop protocol ensures the tokens are burned on the source chain before authorizing the corresponding mint on the destination chain.

When enabling cross-chain functionality for your token, it is essential to evaluate the security, cost, and latency of the respective verification mechanism.


## Why give your token cross-chain functionality with Superchain interop?

*   **Low latency:** 1-block latency ensures fast cross-chain token transfers.
*   **No fees:** Transfers happen at a 1:1 rate with no liquidity poolsâ€”just gas.
*   **Security:** Fault Proofs secure Superchain interop end to end.
*   **[Reorg awareness](./reorg):** Enables 1-block latency cross-chain composability that mitigates the double-spend problem.

## SuperchainERC20

SuperchainERC20 is the simplest and most trust-minimized way to enable token interoperability within the Superchain.

*   **Security:** Fault Proofs secure Superchain interop end to end. No third-party dependencies.
*   **Latency:** 1-block latency within the Superchain interop cluster.
*   **Cost:** Gas on source chain and destination chain. 
*   **Cross-chain address:** Deterministic, no token registry required. 
*   **Supported ecosystem:** Superchain interop cluster.


## Alternative implementation options 

While the SuperchainERC20 is the simplest and recommended implementation for giving your token Superchain interop capabilities, other leading token implementations can also benefit from Superchain interop. If you choose to a token standard other than SuperchainERC20 here are a few things to consider:

### ERC-7802

### Weakest link risk

If you allowlist both Superchain interop and a third-party verification mechanism, your token's security is only as strong as the weakest verification mechanism.

### SuperchainTokenBridge vs. Superchain interop messaging

The [`SuperchainTokenBridge`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/SuperchainTokenBridge.sol) is an abstraction built on top of the **Cross-Domain Messenger (CDM)**.
Anyone can build a custom bridge on the **L2-to-L2 CDM**, but it may not follow the invariant of maintaining the same token address across chains.

If your token requires interoperability beyond the Superchain, you can consider one of the following **ERC-7281-compliant** options. These introduce external dependencies that must be allowlisted.

### xERC20 (ERC-7281)

*   **Security:** Variable due to weakest-link scenario based on allowlisted verification mechanisms.
*   **Latency:** 1-block latency in the Superchain. Outside latency varies based on the messaging service used.
*   **Cost:** Variable based on allowlisted verification mechanisms.
*   **Cross-chain address:** Deterministic or requires cross-chain registry per deployment.
*   **Supported ecosystem:** EVM
*   **Best for:** Projects needing flexible bridge integrations while retaining control over allowlisted bridges.

### OFT

*   **Security:** Variable due to weakest-link scenario based on allowlisted verification mechanisms.
*   **Latency:** 1-block latency within the Superchain. External latency depends on **DVN finality time**.
*   **Cost:** Variable based on allowlisted verification mechanisms.
*   **Cross-chain address:** Requires cross-chain registry per deployment.
*   **Supported ecosystem:** EVM, Solana, MoveVM

### NTT

*   **Security:** Variable due to weakest-link scenario based on allowlisted verification mechanisms.
*   **Latency:** 1-block latency within the Superchain. External latency varies based on transceiver finality.
*   **Cost:** Variable based on allowlisted verification mechanisms.
*   **Cross-chain address:** Requires cross-chain registry per deployment.
*   **Supported ecosystem:** EVM, Solana, MoveVM


### Key takeaways

*   **SuperchainERC20** is the simplest way for token issuers to get Superchain interop cluster wide distribution.
*   Token issuers can use other options (xERC20, OFT, NTT) and allowlist Superchain interop or the SuperchainTokenBridge to benefit from Superchain interop. 
*   When using tokens other than SuperchainERC20, token issuers should include a ERC-7802 interface to simplify developer experience.
*   Using 3rd party verification mechanisms introduces external dependencies and potential security risks.
