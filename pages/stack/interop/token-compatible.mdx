# Superchain interop compatible tokens

Superchain interop enables **secure, gas-only, 1-block latency cross-chain composability** on the [Superchain interop cluster](/stack/interop/explainer#superchain-interop-cluster).
The **recommended** approach for enabling interop capabilities for tokens is using [SuperchainERC20](/stack/interop/superchain-erc20), but there are other options depending on your needs.

## How tokens go cross-chain

Compared to a traditional ERC-20 deployment on a single chain, tokens can move across chains by granting authority to a messaging service (bridge) to **cross-chain mint/burn** them.
When enabling cross-chain functionality, it is essential to evaluate **security, cost, and latency** of the respective messaging service.

## Why Superchain interop messaging?

*   **Low latency:** 1-block latency ensures fast cross-chain token transfers.
*   **No fees:** Transfers happen at a 1:1 rate with no liquidity pools—just gas.
*   **Security:** Protected by the OP Stack's permissionless fault proofs.
*   **[Reorg awareness](./reorg):** Enables 1-block latency cross-chain composability that mitigates the double-spend problem.

## SuperchainERC20 – The Recommended Option

*   **Most secure** – Fully protected by OP Stack permissionless fault proofs. No third-party dependencies.
*   **1-block latency** within the Superchain.
*   **Best for:** **Superchain-native tokens**, that need **the highest security, lowest latency**, and seamless integration within the Superchain


### Weakest link risk

If you allowlist both Superchain interop and a third-party messaging service, your token's security is only as strong as the weakest service.
A compromised third-party service could allow malicious minting or double spending.

### SuperchainTokenBridge vs. Superchain interop messaging

The [`SuperchainTokenBridge`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/SuperchainTokenBridge.sol) is an abstraction built on top of the **Cross-Domain Messenger (CDM)**.
Anyone can build a custom bridge on the **L2-to-L2 CDM**, but it may not follow the invariant of maintaining the same token address across chains.


## Alternative implementation options (ERC-7281 Standard)

If your token requires interoperability beyond the Superchain, you can consider one of the following **ERC-7281-compliant** options. These introduce external dependencies that must be allowlisted.

### xERC20 (ERC-7281)

*   **Security:** Secure within the Superchain. Security outside the Superchain depends on allowlisted third-party bridges.
*   **Latency:** 1-block latency in the Superchain. Outside latency varies based on the messaging service used.
*   **Best for:** Projects needing flexible bridge integrations while retaining control over allowlisted bridges.

### OFT

*   **Security:** Secure within the Superchain. Outside security depends on **allowlisted Decentralized Verification Networks (DVNs)**.
*   **Latency:** 1-block latency within the Superchain. External latency depends on **DVN finality time**.
*   **Best for:** Tokens requiring cross-chain transfer beyond the Superchain (e.g., Solana, Arbitrum).

### NTT

*   **Security:** Secure within the Superchain. External security depends on allowlisted transceivers.
*   **Latency:** 1-block latency within the Superchain. External latency varies based on transceiver finality.
*   **Best for:** Projects that want Wormhole's network for cross-chain transfer. (Superchain integration is still in progress.)

### Key takeaways

*   **SuperchainERC20** is the most secure and recommended option for native Superchain tokens.
*   All other options (xERC20, OFT, NTT) follow the ERC-7281 standard and require allowlisting external verification mechanisms.
*   Interoperability outside the Superchain introduces external dependencies and potential security risks.
