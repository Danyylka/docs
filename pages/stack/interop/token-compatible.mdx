# Superchain interop compatible tokens

Superchain interop enables **trust-minimized, 1-block latency cross-chain composability** on the [Superchain interop cluster](/stack/interop/explainer#superchain-interop-cluster).
The recommended approach for giving tokens Superchain interop capabilities is using [SuperchainERC20](/stack/interop/superchain-erc20), but there are other options depending on your needs.

## How tokens go cross-chain

Compared to traditional ERC-20 tokens deployments on a single blockchain, cross-chain tokens can move between different blockchains through giving `crosschainMint` and `crosschainBurn` permissions to a verification mechanism (such as a bridge protocol) that validates when tokens should be burned on one chain and minted on another.

For example when transferring a SuperchainERC20 between chains in the Superchain interop cluster, the Superchain interop protocol ensures the tokens are burned on the source chain before authorizing the corresponding mint on the destination chain.

When enabling cross-chain functionality for your token, it is essential to evaluate the security, cost, and latency of the respective verification mechanism.


## Why use Superchain interop to move your tokens cross chain?

Apps built with Superchain interop can essentially teleport tokens from one blockchain to another, providing users with a secure, low-latency, and capitally-efficient way to transact on the Superchain.

*   **Low latency:** 1-block latency ensures fast cross-chain token transfers.
*   **0-slippage:** Transfers happen at a 1:1 rate with no need for asset wrapping or liquidity poolsâ€”just pay for gas.
*   **Security:** Fault Proofs secure Superchain interop end to end.
*   **[Reorg awareness](./reorg):** Enables 1-block latency cross-chain composability that mitigates the double-spend problem.

## SuperchainERC20

SuperchainERC20 is a simple and trust-minimized way to enable token interoperability within the Superchain. You can learn more about SuperchainERC20 [here](/stack/interop/superchain-erc20).

*   **Security:** Fault Proofs secure Superchain interop end to end. No third-party dependencies to enable token interoperability.
*   **Latency:** 1-block latency within the Superchain interop cluster.
*   **Cost:** Gas on source chain and destination chain. 
*   **Cross-chain address:** Deterministic, no token registry required. 
*   **Supported ecosystem:** Superchain interop cluster.


## Alternative implementation options 

While the SuperchainERC20 is a trust-minimized way to enable for giving your token Superchain interop capabilities, other token implementations can also benefit from Superchain interop. If you choose a token standard other than SuperchainERC20 here are a few things to consider:

#### ERC-7802
[`ERC-7802`](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-7802-crosschain-token-interface/21508) is a minimal cross-chain mint/burn interface designed to establish a common standard across the EVM ecosystem for tokens to communicate cross-chain. Adding this interface to your token ensures downstream integrators can easily support your token.

#### SuperchainTokenBridge and L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger
Tokens can benefit from Superchain interop by either giving cross-chain mint/burn permissions to the `SuperchainTokenBridge` or the `L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger`. 

The [`SuperchainTokenBridge`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/SuperchainTokenBridge.sol) is an abstraction built on top of the [`L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger.sol) that facilitates token bridging using Superchain interop, but requires the token address be deterministic across chains. 

Alternatively, you can use the `L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger` to faclitate cross-chain mint/burns and **does not** require a deterministic address across chains but requires the token issuer to manage a token registry per chain. 

#### Weakest link scenario

If you allowlist both Superchain interop and a third-party verification mechanism, your token's security is only as strong as the weakest verification mechanism.

### xERC20 (ERC-7281)

xERC20 tokens are crosschain ERC-20 which can be transferred across chains by allowing the token owner to approve which bridges can mint/burn their token and the ability to set rate limits per bridge. You can learn more about xERC20 and Superchain interop [here](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/203).

*   **Security:** Variable due to weakest-link scenario based on allowlisted verification mechanisms.
*   **Latency:** 1-block latency in the Superchain. Outside the Superchain, latency is variable based on allowlisted verification mechanism.
*   **Cost:** Variable based on allowlisted verification mechanisms.
*   **Cross-chain address:** Deterministic or requires cross-chain registry per deployment.
*   **Supported ecosystem:** EVM

### OFT

OFT is a token standard used to send, receive, and compose assets across all the chains LayerZero supports. More information will be added about how OFTs can benefit from Superchain interop at a later date. 

*   **Security:** Variable due to weakest-link scenario based on allowlisted verification mechanisms.
*   **Latency:** 1-block latency within the Superchain. Outside the Superchain, latency is variable based on allowlisted verification (DVN) mechanism.
*   **Cost:** Variable based on allowlisted verification mechanisms.
*   **Cross-chain address:** Requires cross-chain registry per deployment.
*   **Supported ecosystem:** EVM, Solana, MoveVM

### NTT

NTT is a token standard used to send, receive, and compose assets across all the chains Wormhole supports. More information will be added about how NTTs can benefit from Superchain interop at a later date. 

*   **Security:** Variable due to weakest-link scenario based on allowlisted verification mechanisms.
*   **Latency:** 1-block latency within the Superchain. Outside the Superchain, latency is variable based on allowlisted verification (transceiver) mechanism.
*   **Cost:** Variable based on allowlisted verification mechanisms.
*   **Cross-chain address:** Requires cross-chain registry per deployment.
*   **Supported ecosystem:** EVM, Solana, MoveVM


## Key takeaways

*   `SuperchainERC20` is a simple and trust-minimized way for token issuers to make their token available across the Superchain interop cluster.
*   Token issuers can use other token standards (xERC20, OFT, NTT) and give  `crosschainMint` and `crosschainBurn` permissions to the `SuperchainTokenBridge` or `L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger` to benefit from Superchain interop. 
*   Token issuers should include a ERC-7802 interface on their token to simplify downstream integrations.
*   Using 3rd party verification mechanisms introduces additional trust assumptions.
