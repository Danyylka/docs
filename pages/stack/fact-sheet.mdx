# Overview
Get an overview of the capabilities associated with an OP Stack chain.

While the OP Stack allows for full customization, chains in the Superchain adhere to a [consistent set of technical and governance parameters](/superchain/blockspace-charter), facilitating Superchain interoperability, network security, and ease of upgrading your chain.

<sup>3</sup>While protocol blocktimes can be lowered to 1 second, subsecond blocktimes can be achieved using Flashblocks.

<sup>4</sup>Although ETH is the gas token, chain operators can achieve the same UX of a custom gas token by using an ERC-20 paymaster.
