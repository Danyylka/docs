# Overview
Get an overview of the capabilities associated with an OP Stack chain.

While the OP Stack allows for full customization, chains in the Superchain adhere to a [consistent set of technical and governance parameters](/superchain/blockspace-charter), facilitating Superchain interoperability, network security, and ease of upgrading your chain.

| Feature                            | Superchain                    | OP Stack                    |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Parent chain**                   | Ethereum                      | Ethereum, any Ethereum L2   |
| **Throughput (mgas/s)**            | 40                            | 50                          |
| **Gas limit**                      | 100m                          | 100m                        |
| **Blocktimes<sup>1</sup>**         | 250ms                         | 250ms                       |
| **Data availability support**      | Ethereum                      | Ethereum, Celestia, EigenDA |
| **Gas token support<sup>2</sup>**  | ETH                           | ETH                         |
| **Upgrades**                       | Facilitated via OP Governance | Self-managed                |
| **EVM compatability**              | Equivalent                    | Variable                    |

<sup>1</sup>While protocol blocktimes can be lowered to 1 second, subsecond blocktimes can be achieved using Flashblocks.

<sup>2</sup>Although ETH is the gas token, chain operators can achieve the same UX of a custom gas token by using an ERC-20 paymaster.
